\begin{abstract}
Route subnetwork generation is useful in modelling disaster emergency response operation problems such as evacuation, aid distribution, and personnel scheduling. Through this paper, we propose an end-to-end approach of generating subnetwork based on list of point of interests (villages, shelters, depots, etc) and publicly available data using combination of opensources tools. The end result is an opensource software available in public code repository. We also present some experiment results for three areas in Indonesia: Jakarta, Lombok, and Yogyakarta.

\section{Introduction}

Route subnetwork generation is a process of extracting some portion of map data (eg. OpenStreetMap data) to build a graph where point of interest (POI) nodes are connected by minimum required routes as edges. This subnetwork is useful in modelling emergency response problems such as evacuation, aid distribution, and personnel scheduling.

The goal of the subnetwork generation is to process list of POI (POI ID, POI category, latitude, and longitude) to generate a subnetwork network/graph where:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Each nodes represents POI or route intersection
\item Each edges represents route between node
\item Only routes that are required to connect POIs included
\item Each nodes has risk index (greater value means greater risk)
\item Each routes has risk index derived from its nodes' risk
\end{enumerate} 

The example expected subnetwork is visualized in Figure \ref{fig_jakarta_subnetwork_visualized}.

\section{Related Works}

OpenStreetMap.org (OSM) \cite{haklay2008openstreetmap} is an open community-driven map data provider that provides standard and data needed to build a subnetwork for emergency response problem modellling. The problem is that it contains too much data so filtering and extraction are needed. 

OpenStreetMap.id is a website that provides extracted OSM data for most provinces in Indonesia in Protocolbuffer Binary Format (PBF). This website solved the issue regarding regional data extraction. 

INARISK\footnote{http://service1.inarisk.bnpb.go.id:6080/arcgis/rest/services/inaRISK} is a public Geographic Information System provided by The National Agency for Disaster Countermeasure of Indonesia. This system provides information about the disaster risk index of all regions in Indonesia in a form of colored map layer as shown in Figure \ref{fig_jakarta_flood_risk_layer_inarisk}.

\begin{figure}

\caption{Jakarta flood disaster risk index from INARISK}
\label{fig_jakarta_flood_risk_layer_inarisk}
\end{figure}

OsmToRoadGraph\footnote{https://github.com/AndGem/OsmToRoadGraph} is an opensource tool to generate graph/network from raw OSM data. Since the OpenStreetMap.id only provides PBF file, we will need additional tool called Osmconvert\footnote{https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmconvert} to convert PBF to OSM before using OsmToRoadGraph to generate graph/network data in PYCGR/PYCGRC and JSON format.

PostGIS\footnote{https://postgis.net/} is an spatial data extension of one of the most popular opensource database, PostgreSQL\footnote{https://postgresql.org/}. PostGIS allows us to map each POIs provided by user to their nearest node in PYCGR file. The only thing left to solve is to remove unecessary nodes and routes from the graph to reduce the size of final input data for the model.

NetworkX\footnote{https://networkx.org/} is an opensource Python package that provides data structure and APIs for complex graph search and manipulations. This package provides a way to remove unecessary nodes and routes in order to generate minimized subnetwork/subgraph suitable for modelling.


%The IEEEtran class file is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins, 
%column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not 
%alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin
%measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement 
%and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper 
%as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document. 
%Please do not revise any of the current designations \cite{haklay2008openstreetmap}.

\section{Methodology}

In a nutshell, the methodology that we propose is combining related tools into a new system to generate route subnetwork from POIs of emergency response operation. The flowchart of the system is shown in Figure \ref{fig_system_flowchart}.

These are the steps that our proposed subnetwork generator does to generate the route subnetwork:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Loads OSM nodes information from PYCGR/PYCGRC file to PostGIS-extended PostgreSQL database
\item Loads POI list and find nearest OSM nodes
\item Loads JSON graph and finds minimal nodes/edges required by combining shortest paths of POIs permutation pairs
\item Finds risk index of each nodes by converting pixel colors in INARISK risk layer image. Manually searched pixel-to-coordinates samples are required to estimate the corresponding pixel for each node's coordinates (latitude/longitude)
\item Writes output files that represent the route subnetwork, risk index, and mapping to input POIs
\end{enumerate}

Additionally we also provide a simple webserver that render the subnetwork on top of interactive map as shown in Figure \ref{fig_jakarta_subnetwork_visualized}.

The source code of our proposed system along with its usage guide are currently published in a publicly accessible code repository\footnote{https://github.com/yohanesgultom/respondor}. 

%\subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}
%
%Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
%of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
%to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
%citations without having to go through the file line by line.
%
%Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
%\verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
%environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.
%
%Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
%will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
%equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
%article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
%the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
%counting.
%
%{\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
%data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
%bibliography you must send the .bib files. 
%
%{\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
%subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
%referenced as Table IV-B3. 
%
%{\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
%\verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
%supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
%cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
%should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.
%
%Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
%will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
%any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
%surrounding equation.

\section{Experiments}

In order to validate and test performance of our proposed system, we generated route subnetwork for three emergency response operations:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Yogyakarta earthquake
\item Jakarta flood
\item Lombok earthquake
\end{enumerate}

We used a computer with following specifications used to run the experiments:

\begin{itemize}
\item CPU: AMD Ryzen Threadripper 3970X 32-Core Processor
\item RAM: DDR4 64 GB
\item Storage: SCSI 4 TB
\item OS: Ubuntu 18.04
\end{itemize}

The experiment results are shown in Table \ref{table_experiment_results}.

%separate text file. Complete all content and organizational editing before

%\subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
%\item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
%\item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
%\item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
%\item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
%\item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
%\item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
%\item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
%\item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
%\item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
%\item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
%\end{itemize}
%An excellent style manual for science writers is .
%
%\subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}\label{AA}
%Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text, 
%even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as 
%IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use 
%abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.
%
%\subsection{Units}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
%\item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
%\item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
%\item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
%\end{itemize}
%
%\subsection{Equations}
%Number equations consecutively. To make your 
%equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or 
%appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables, 
%but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus 
%sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a 
%sentence, as in:
%\begin{equation}
%a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
%\end{equation}
%
%Be sure that the 
%symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following 
%the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at 
%the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''
%
%
%\subsection{Authors and Affiliations}
%\textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A 
%minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names 
%should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the 
%next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations 
%and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by 
%affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for 
%example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).
%
%\subsection{Identify the Headings}
%Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through 
%your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.
%
%Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not 
%topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and 
%References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use 
%``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your 
%table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a 
%style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop 
%down menu to differentiate the head from the text.
%
%Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For 
%example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent 
%material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more 
%sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used 
%and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads 
%should be introduced.
%
%\subsection{Figures and Tables}
%\paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and 
%bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large 
%figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be 
%below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert 
%figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation 
%``Fig.~\ref{fig_jakarta_subnetwork_visualized}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

%\begin{table}[htbp]
%\caption{Table Type Styles}
%\begin{center}
%\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
%\hline
%\textbf{Table}&\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\textbf{Table Column Head}} \\
%\cline{2-4} 
%\textbf{Head} & \textbf{\textit{Table column subhead}}& \textbf{\textit{Subhead}}& \textbf{\textit{Subhead}} \\

%\hline
%\multicolumn{4}{l}{$^{\mathrm{a}}$Sample of a Table footnote.}
%\end{tabular}
%\label{tab1}
%\end{center}
%\end{table}

%Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words 
%rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to 
%avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity 
%``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including 
%units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only 
%with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization 
%\{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of 
%quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not 
%``Temperature/K''.

\section{Conclusion}

The proposed system was able to generate route subnetwork for all operations within considerable processing time. In the future, we suggest to implement the process of finding minimally required routes and nodes to run on Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) so that the processing time can be more scalable.

%\section*{Acknowledgment}
%
%The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
%an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
%G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
%acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

%\section*{References}

%Please number citations consecutively within brackets . The 
%sentence punctuation follows the bracket . Refer simply to the reference 
%number, as in ---do not use ``Ref. '' or ``reference '' except at 
%the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference  was the first $\ldots$''
%
%Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at 
%the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the 
%abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.
%
%Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use 
%``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been 
%submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' . Papers 
%that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press''. 
%Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and 
%element symbols.
